# Mid_project

## 1. Introduction:

The topic of my project is hotel bookings. We will explore and clean the data set. Answer all the questions and predict whether a booking will be cancelled or not.

## 2. Project Questions:

* Question 1: Are there specific months where bookings peak?
* Question 2: How do booking trends vary between different types of hotels?
* Question 3: How are cancellations and no-shows distributed in the dataset?
* Question 4: Which countries do most of the guests come from?
* Question 5: How does the average duration of stay vary between different types of hotels?
* Question 6: How does the average daily rate (ADR) vary across different months? Are there specific periods where hotels can charge a premium due to high demand?
* Question 7: How does the Monthly Cancellation Rate (MCR), vary between different types of hotels throughout the year?
* ML Model: Predict whether a booking will be canceled or not.

* The data set was pretty clean. 
* Found an answer to all the questions
* The model demonstrates an accuracy of 84.57% in predicting booking cancellations.

## 5. Conclusions

* Learned how to execute a project from beginning till completion.

## 6. Next steps:
